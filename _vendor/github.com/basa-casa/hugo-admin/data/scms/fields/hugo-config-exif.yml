    hint: Regexp matching the fields you want to Exclude from the (massive) set of
      Exif info available. As we cache this info to disk, this is for
      performance and disk space reasons more than anything. If you want it all,
      put ".*" in this config setting. Note that if neither this or
      ExcludeFields is set, Hugo will return a small default set.
  - field_type: string
    widget: string
    required: false
    name: excludeFields
    label: excludeFields
    hint: Regexp matching the Exif fields you want to exclude. This may be easier to
      use than IncludeFields above, depending on what you want.
  - field_type: boolean
    widget: boolean
    required: false
    name: disableDate
    label: disableDate
    hint: Hugo extracts the "photo taken" date/time into .Date by default. Set this
      to true to turn it off.
  - field_type: boolean
    widget: boolean
    required: false
    name: disableLatLong
    label: disableLatLong
    hint: |-
      Hugo extracts the "photo taken where" (GPS latitude and longitude) into
      .Long and .Lat. Set this to true to turn it off.
