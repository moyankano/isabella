name: related
widget: object
field_type: object
required: false
fields: 
  - name: threshold
    widget: number
    field_type: number
    required: false 
    hint:  A value between 0-100. Lower value will give more, but maybe not so relevant, matches.
  - name: includeNewer
    widget: boolean
    field_type: boolean
    required: false 
    hint:  Set to true to include **pages newer than the current page** in the related content listing. This will mean that the output for older posts may change as new related content gets added.
  - name: toLower
    widget: boolean
    field_type: boolean
    required: false 
    hint: Set to true to lower case keywords in both the indexes and the queries. This may give more accurate results at a slight performance penalty. Note that this can also be set per index.
  - name: indices
    widget: list
    field_type: list
    required: false
    fields: 
      - name: name
        widget: string
        field_type: string
        required: false
        hint:  The index name. This value maps directly to a page param. Hugo supports string values (`author` in the example) and lists (`tags`, `keywords` etc.) and time and date objects.
      - name: weight
        widget: number
        field_type: number
        hint: An integer weight that indicates _how important_ this parameter is relative to the other parameters.  It can be 0, which has the effect of turning this index off, or even negative. Test with different values to see what fits your content best.
      - name: pattern
        widget: string
        field_type: string
        required: false
        hint: This is currently only relevant for dates. When listing related content, we may want to list content that is also close in time. Setting "2006" (default value for date indexes) as the pattern for a date index will add weight to pages published in the same year. For busier blogs, "200601" (year and month) may be a better default.
      - name: toLower
        widget: boolean
        field_type: boolean
        required: false
        hint: See above.
